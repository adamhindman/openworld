\"What do you know about the USS <em>Aaron Ward</em>?\"</p><p>The man's voice on the phone is low and gruff. A cigar smoker's voice, most likely. Older, you'd say late middle age. Educated and commanding. You'd say this is a man used to asking questions.</p><p>\"The <em>Aaron Ward</em> was a U.S. Navy destroyer in WWII. It sank just off the tip of Florida Island, in the Solomons. Japanese dive bombers. February 6, 1943.\"</p><p>\"Very good. You know your history. But do you know about the treasure?\"</p><p>Four days later, you are diving through the murky water of Iron Bottom Sound, graveyard for dozens of war ships and planes from the battle for nearby Guadalcanal. </p><p>You check your air tanks, and find them almost full. You are diving alone, to minimize the number of people who know why you're here. The old man warned you you might be followed, but checked over your shoulder a hundred times, and the coast was clear. Still, you can't shake the feeling of being watched.</p><p> </p><p>Moments later, the large, twisted bulk of the <em>Aaron Ward</em> emerges from the dark water, and you swim inside through a breach in the hull. </p><p>\"My father served on the <em>Ortolan</em>, a minesweeper that helped rescue surivors on the <em>Ward</em>. One of the sailors he couldn't save, a midshipman from Illinois, told him about the treasure as he lay dying.</p><p>\"As water poured into the compartment, the man told him about a certain solid gold crucifix, looted by the Japanese from a Catholic mission on one of the islands, and currently housed on board the sinking ship.\"</p><p>\"How did the crucifix get onto the <em>Aaron Ward</em>?\"</p><p>\"It was... well, let's say it was... re-appropriated. The Japanese officer who stole it no longer had need of it.\"</p><p>\"The Catholic mission, the Japanese officer, and then the sailor who took it. Sounds like this crucifix is bad luck for whoever has it.\"</p><p>\"I don't believe in luck. I believe in the power of money, and that crucifix is worth a lot of it.\"</p><p>You ask why the man's father didn't take the crucifix with him eighty years ago. He laughs, and tells you there is a very good reason for that.</p><p>The light from your cutting torch illuminates the rear section of the ship, casting long, sharp shadows onto the muddy, algae-covered floor. The pressurized cutting medium glows blue-bright, a high-ratio mix of oxygen and acetyene gas burning through steel at over 6000 degrees.</p><p>You had to get a permit to buy this equipment, and take a special course. Most of the other students in the underwater welding course were oil rig or pipeline workers. When asked to introduce yourself to the class, and list a fun fact about yourself, you said \"I'm a treasure hunter, and my favorite fruit is bananas.\"</p><p>Once you've cut all the way through the hinges of the bulkhead door, you are able to pry it open. Eighty years ago, the compartment behind it had filled with water, making it impossible to enter. That water doesn't make any difference to you now, but the years of corrosion had thoroughly stuck the door shut.</p><p>The crucifix is right where the man said it would be, hidden in a crate marked 'crackers'. The wooden box has mostly rotted away, but you can see a glimmer of bright metal inside.</p><p>The crucifix is large, almost a foot long, and very heavy. The gold, and the jewels that decorate it, glint in the light of your headlamp. You feel the weight of it in your hands; not only the weight of the metal, but of the history behind it.</p><p>Movement reflected in the smooth surface. Turning around, you see a knife arcing through the water, in a long swipe that would have cut your air hose. Another diver has followed you into the wreck!</p><p>On pure reflex, you bring the crucifix up to block the attack. The silver of the steel cuts into the soft gold, leaving a deep gouge. </p><p>You fight the attacker across the deck. You manage to crack his breathing mask, forcing him to push away from you and swim to the surface. You use the distraction to escape the wreck, and return to your boat. When you break the surface, your mysterious attacker is gone.</p><p>\"A dangerous job, but worth the risk,\" says the man. \"You did well.\"</p><p>You're meeting him in person for the first time, on his yacht off the coast of Honiara.</p><p>\"Here is your payment,\" he says, handing you a briefcase. You hand him the crucifix, wrapped in cloth.</p><p>\"I'd like to know who tried to kill me,\" you say.</p><p>\"How would I know? You must have let something slip. Did you tell anyone you were hunting for treasure?\"</p><p>His eyes light up as he unwraps the crucifix. You wonder whether the story about his father and the sailor was true. </p><p>\"May it bring you good luck,\" you say.</p><p>Later, in your hotel room, you open the briefcase. It is full of bananas. Nothing but bananas. When you try to track down the man and his yacht, they are gone.
