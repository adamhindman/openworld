A near stranger hands you a dried gourd filled with a hot liquid. It is called <em>mate</em>, she explains to you: \"pronounced 'mah-tay'\". </p><p></p><p>It's a kind of tea, brewed by pouring hot water over the dried leaves of a particular holly plant. </p><p></p><p>\"You drink it with a metal straw, called a <em>bombilla</em>, like this,\" she says, taking a sip from her own gourd. </p><p></p><p>\"The straw has a filter at the end, to keep out any small bits of leaves. In paraguay, it's pretty much our national drink. You'll love it, I promise."</p><p></p><p>You tentatively take a pull from the straw. The mate tastes bitter, but pleasant. It's mild and earthy.</p><p></p><p>\"I like it,\" you say.</p><p></p><p>\"You should sip the mate throughout the day, to keep you awake and full of energy. It's got caffeine in it, so be careful not to drink too much!\"</p><p></p><p>But by then it is too late: you are already half way through your fourth gourd of the delicious brew.</p><p></p><p>The caffeine rush hits you like a freight train, and yoi begin running around the capitol city of Asunción. </p><p></p><p>You tour the Palacio de los López, and then the National Pantheon of Heroes. You run to the other end of the city, and buzz through some markets, to buy a traditional pancho, and refuel on three more gourds (large gourds) of that delicious yerba mate. </p><p></p><p>\"I've never felt more alive,\" you say. </p><p></p><p>You are jogging down the road from Asunción to Loma Plata, and you don't know how much time has passed. You are holding a gourd of mate, a different one from the one you had before. It contains not one but three <em>bombillas</em>, and you suddenly remember the moment when you realized you could drink mate faster with more straws. </p><p></p><p>You shotgun the gourd of the mate and keep running, running, running, faster, faster, faster.
