Orava Castle is an impressive, 700 year old castle built on a spur of rock overlooking the Orava river, and the picturesque village of Oravský Podzámok, in central Slovakia. The old building exudes a powerful feeling of shadowy, gothic horror — maybe that's why it has been the setting of so many vampire movies over the years. </p><p>You hear about a new vampire movie filming on location at the castle, and decide to join the cast. After going through multiple rounds of auditions and callbacks, you finally land the part of a minor vampire, a servant of the main vampire (no spoilers, but it's Count Dracula). Your big scene comes near the middle of the picture, when you try to sneak up on the hero and suck his blood while he's chopping vegetables for a stew. </p><p>You creep up behind him, wearing a big black vampire cape. It's somewhat distracting, because instead of being in a regular room, you're on a set, and there are dozens of crew members standing around holding cameras, microphones, lights, and so on. The director sits close by, in a tall, specially designed chair that folds up, so that it can be moved from location to location. The chair has her name on it the back.</p><p>\"Cut!\" the director yells. She seems frustrated, but is trying to remain polite.</p><p>\"Vampire Minion, what's going on? Your sightlines were all over the place.\"</p><p>\"I was looking at the cameras, lighting rigs, and boom microphones,\" you admit. A film set is a fascinating place to be, and you don't want to miss anything.</p><p>\"Just look at Benedict,\" says the director. \"Look at him like you want to bite his neck, because that's what your character wants.\"</p><p>She's talking about Benedict Cumberbatch, the star of the picture. He is playing the hero, a famous vampire hunteer who is visiting the village.</p><p>On the second take, you focus on not being distracted by the film crew. You sneak across the room, toward Benedict Cumberbatch, who is facing away from you, busily chopping vegetables. You have a sinister look on your face, like: \"I'm about to suck your blood, and you don't even know it.\"</p><p>As you approach him, the camera operator pulls focus away from you, toward a closeup of Cumberbatch's hands. He is holding a kitchen knife in one hand, and a carrot in the other. As everybody knows, a sharp knife is no good against a vampire: only a stake through the heart can kill them.</p><p>In an insert shot, we see the hero realize there is someone behind him, then quickly cut the end of the carrot into a sharp point. Then, the camera cuts to an action shot of Cumberbatch whipping around, and driving the sharpened carrot straight into your heart. That part was done by two stunt performers, a week before you arrived on set. The shot of your body turning to stone and shattering into a million pieces of dust was added later, by a digital effects studio in Croatia.  </p><p>After the scene is completed, you are released from set for the day, and go on a tour of the castle. You learn that large parts of the castle had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1800. You also learn that Orava was used as a model for a castle in something called The Witcher.</p><p>Thinking it might help inform his performance, you tell this to the star when you see him walking to his car after shooting has completed. </p><p>\"Not just vampires, but witches too, huh? Pretty wild stuff! Right?\"</p><p>When the movie comes out the next year, you notice that the stew-making scene was removed entirely. In the theatrical cut of the movie, you are only visible in the background of a single shot. You are staring at something off camera, most likely a teamster.
