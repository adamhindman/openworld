\"... Is that all?\" </p><p>\"That's all,\" you say, with finality. \"That's the story of how I visited every country, including the ones on Mars, and the fictional ones, and the ones that aren't really countries. That's a lot. Not enough for you two, eh?\"</p><p>They both shake their heads. </p><p>The boy says: \"Where did you go after that? Did you meet any more ghosts?\"</p><p>The girl says: \"Did you go into any more caves? Did you solve any crimes?\"</p><p>You chuckle. With effort, you get out of your very comfortable chair. You find the old, time-worn key from the drawer in your desk, and hold it up for them to see. Their eyes widen.</p><p>\"Have I ever opened up the gallery for you children? No? Well, maybe it's time.\"</p><p>They follow you excitedly down the hall, to the tall double doors which have always been locked to them, and so have always held so much fascination for them. They are talking to each other, whispering something your old ears cannot quite make out.</p><p>\"I brought some things home with me from my trip, and most of them are stored in here.\"</p><p>When you flick the lightswitch on, many rows of shelves and cabinets can be seen. The air is stale, and every surface is covered in a layer of dust. </p><p>\"It's been a long time since anyone came in here. Please, feel free to look around.\"


  // return `Standing at the edge of ${curLocation}, your mind returns, as it often does, to memories of the places you've been in your long, fascinating journey. You've visited all ${globe.length} countries of the world, including those on Mars, and those which are fictional, and those which aren't really countries at all. Old countries, young countries, rich and poor ones.</p><p>You've had narrow escapes from death, and long periods of exhaustion, to be sure, but also many joyful hours with friends, and splendid glimpses of a world which grew more magical — and somehow less familiar — the more you saw of it. You've experienced many things few people have before, and a few which none may ever see again. You think about these things, one by one, staring out from ${curLocation} at the end of your journey.</p><p>`
