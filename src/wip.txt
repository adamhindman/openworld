You are in the lovely seaside city of Victoria, capital of the Seychelles. You're wandering around on 5th June avenue, strolling in the shadows of palm trees, with a cool breeze rolling up the hill from the nearby bay.</p><p>You are looking for your friend, Tabitha, who sells linens and bedding. When she heard you were visiting her native land, she invited to take you on a yachting tour of the archipelago today.</p><p>Unfortunately, you got carried away seeing the sights in downtown Victoria, and lost track of time. Now, you're late, and you can't find her store!</p><p>You stop a local and ask him if he knows someone named Tabitha.</p><p>He shakes his head:</p><p>\"There are over 26,000 people living here in Victoria, and I know quite a few of them. But, you'll have to narrow it down for me. Can you tell me anything about your friend?\"</p><p>\"She's an avid sailor. She loves to sail her sloop over to  Grand Anse, Silhouette, even out to Fregate.\"</p><p>He scratches his long, white beard.</p><p>\"Hmm, she sails. That's helpful, but it doesn't narrow it down very much. As you may imagine, there are many people enjoy boating, given that we're on an island. What else can you tell me?\"</p><p>\"She runs a store specializing in luxury bedding. How many people fit that description?\"</p><p>The old man raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\"You might be surprised. There are a number of stores that fit that description around here. Where is your friend's shop located?\"</p><p>\"I know it's not far from where her boat is moored, so it must be near the ocean.\"</p><p>\"Ahh ha!\" he says, jabbing a finger into the air excitedly. \"I know exactly the place! Let me take you there.\"</p><p>He grabs you by the sleeve and marches you swiftly right to Tabitha's shop. It turns out, you were only a few blocks away. It looks like she is closing up the shop for the day. She is glad to see you, and also greets the old man who led you to her with a warm smile, as though they were old friends.</p><p>\"You two already know each other?\" you ask.</p><p>\"Of course I know Tabitha. She sails Seychelles, down by the sheet store!\"
