Every year, thousands of tourists like you flock to the top of Table Mountain, overlooking Cape Town. It's an impressive sight, a 3500-foot high wall of sandstone, perfectly flat on top. 

From just about anywhere in the city, you only have to look up to see this geological wonder. It's hard to miss: you catch it out of the corner of your eye while walking through the streets of the city, or spy it in the distance from a boat in the harbor. The sight of it takes your breath away. It is a ubiquitous presence, the defining visual feature of South Africa's capital. Table Mountain is your companion everywhere you go in Cape Town.

In fact, just about the only place where you can't see Table Mountain is when you are standing on top of it. From here, it looks like any other mountain: rocks, brush, some trees. The occasional a bird or mountain rodent. 

Sure, the view down into the city below is great: amazing, really. But you could get the same view from many of the equally tall, non-flat mountains nearby. For example: Devil's Peak, or Signal Hill. Lots fewer tourists there, too. Why did you hike up here again?
