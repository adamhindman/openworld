In 1452, The Virgin Mary appeared to two fishermen in the Bay of Kotor, on a tiny pile of rocks in the middle of the water. Naturally, they built a church there, and that church is called Our Lady of the Rocks. </p><p></p><p>The church sits on a platform of stone, atop an island of rocks. These rocks were filled in by the fishermen, but also by the local faithful, who drop small rocks into the lake in order to expand the size of the church, bit by bit. </p><p></p><p>Normally, the church isn't hard to see from nearby Perast, where you're staying, but looking out at the bay from your hotel room this morning, you couldn't see it at all. </p><p></p><p>At breakfast, the disappearing church is all anybody can talk about. Where did it go? There was an earthquake last night, one of the guests points out. Some of the guests nod, others admit they slept right through it. Always a sound sleeper, you were in the latter group: you didn't notice a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe the church sank during the earthquake?"</p><p></p><p>At this, everyone at the breakfast table gets quiet. It's a sad thought, imagining that a 600 year old church could just slide into the sea one night, while you were sleeping. It survived through all the disasters and wars of the last half millenium, only to succumb to a measly little earthquake. Something isn't right, and you intend to investigate.</p><p></p><p>"Something isn't right," you say, slamming your fist down on the table, "and I intend to investigate!"</p><p></p><p>Two of the others (Peter and Agatha) agree to join you, so you all take a rowboat out to the island, vowing to get to the bottom of the mystery. </p><p></p><p>When you get to where the church used to be, you find only a flat area of piled stones, just below the surface of the water. Granted, it's about the size of the church, but it doesn't look like debris at all. If the church itself had collapsed after the earthquake, you'd certainly expect to see a chaotic mess of masonry, roofing tiles, and the like, but this all looks like ordinary, irregularly-shaped stones.</p><p></p><p>"It's just the pile of rocks the church was built on," says Agatha, "I'd expect the ruins of the church to be on top of it."</p><p></p><p>"It might all have been fallen away from the pile," Peter offers, uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"There's another possibility," you point out. "the church might have floated away."</p><p></p><p>You explain your theory: maybe the earthquake jostled the church just enough to break the connection between the platform the church was built on, and the pile of rocks that supported it. </p><p></p><p>"That's crazy, it would just sink, not float away. The church is made out of rocks, and rock is heavier than water." </p><p></p><p>Peter points to a nearby sunken rock, as though it were new information to anyone.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe not," you say. "Aircraft carriers are made out of steel, and steel is heavier than water too. If the platform was broad enough, and sturdy enough, it might just work."</p><p></p><p>"Look!"</p><p></p><p>Agatha is staring at the horizon. You turn to follow her gaze, and see a small building with a larger dome, and a smaller domed tower bobbing in the waves. </p><p></p><p>You row toward it, and find that your theory was correct: Our Lady of the Rocks is floating, "unmoored", right in the middle of the water. In fact, the stiff morning wind has caught it, and brought it halfway to the mouth of the Adriatic! </p><p></p><p>Bringing your boat alongside, you are greeted by the priest and caretaker, who wave to you. They explain how they slept through the earthquake as well, and upon waking in the morning, discovered themselves adrift, and unable to signal for help. They were beginning to be worried they might end up lost in the shipping lanes</p><p></p><p>Later, when the church has been returned to its former location, you row out to the island again to inspect it. The priest shows you how concrete footings have been added to the building platform to prevent it from separating again. He also tells you that he has purchased a flare gun, two life jackets, and a ship-to-shore radio, though he reassures you that they won't be necessary.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe you should have this instead," you say, handing him a paddle.
