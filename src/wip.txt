While wandering around the Ikh Khorig region of Mongolia, you trip over a rock and accidentally discover the lost tomb of Genghis Khan. </p><p>Genghis (or Temüjin) was one of the most successful rulers in history. He led the Mongol empire to conquer most of the known world, and set up a dynasty that lasted 300 years. When he died, his remains buried in secret and, according to legend, everyone who knew the location was subsequently killed, with the assassins finally committing suicide to close the loop. Its location has been one of history's great unsolved mysteries, until today.</p><p>The location of Genghis Khan's tomb is: near Ikh Khorig, kind of by a hill, right next to a rock that's really easy to trip over if you aren't careful. </p><p>Inside, you find numerous underground vaults piled to the ceiling with treasures, and sacred artifacts given as tribute by a hundred kings, warlords, and generals. It seems like there is enough wealth in each of the 72 rooms here to start a small country of your own. </p><p>Each room is designed to foil grave robbers, and you have to evade a series of deadly traps, spikes and poisoned arrows as you move deeper into the labyrinth. In one ingeniously-designed room, you have to answer a riddle by putting the correct gem in the mouth of a different animal. </p><p>In the central room, lying on a plinth that appears to be solid gold, are the remains of Temüjin himself. Somehow, they are perfectly preserved, despite being more than 800 years old. It looks like he might open his eyes, turn to look at you, and say "who the heck are you?" in the Middle Mongolian language. </p><p>You fill your pockets with treasure, and head back to UlaanBaatar. By the time you get your hands on a map, you've forgotten the exact location of the tomb, but you're sure you can probably find it again.
