After making an honest effort to be admitted into the Circuit de Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix, and being shot down multiple times by the committee, and their so-called "rules", you decide to take drastic action. </p><p></p><p>On the night of the Grand Prix race, you break into the museum which houses the royal car collection. You borrow Prince Rainier III's 1963 Ferrari 250 GT. You leave a brief note explaining the situation, and the cruel actions of the committee that led you to this scurrilous end. If all goes according to plan, you will have the car back in place in the museum before anybody finds out. But, it seems right honest to leave a note, just in case.</p><p></p><p>As the race starts, you drop the hammer on this pristine Ferrari, crashing through a barrier to enter the track just before turn 1.</p><p></p><p>The current Prince, Albert II has kept his father's rare vehicle in great condition. Despite its advanced age, the mmighty V12 engine roars like a lion and leaps forward, approaching the back of the pack.</p><p></p><p>The cars in front of you have several advantages: they are 60 years newer, with more powerful engines, and much better suspensions, brakes, and tires. They are lighter, and more aerodynamic. Their top speed is much higher, and so is their cornering speed, and their acceleration, and their braking. And their cornering. Their drivers are professionals, and many of them have raced this course before.</p><p></p><p>No doubt about it, you've got your work cut out for you today. But the cherry red Ferrari has spent too long in a museum, and it feels like it wants to run. </p><p></p><p>So you let it. </p><p></p><p>On turn 2, you go flat out, and catch up to the last driver. He seems surprised to see an antique collectible vehicle driving by a tourist in his rear view mirror, and you use this surprise to overtake him on the Massenet curve. You honk the horn as you pass. </p><p></p><p>By the time you approach Turn 6, the famous "Fairmont Hairpin", you're near the middle of the pack, with a bunch of very angry drivers jockeying for position behind you. </p><p></p><p>Fairmont is famously tight, and even the high-tech F1 cars have to slow to a crawl to get around it without slamming into the barricade. You decide to take a risk, and fly into the corner at a break-neck speed, flicking the back wheels out and drifting around the corner, passing several vehicles in the process. Looking in your side-view mirror, you see the back end of the vehicle miss the walls of the barricade by no more than a centimeter. </p><p></p><p>You hold your position through a series of turns, then slalom through some tricky chicanes, passing more vehicles. The crowds are cheering for you, so you roll down the window and wave at them as you pass by.</p><p></p><p>With the windows down, you can hear police sirens approaching, and you decide you need to make a move.</p><p></p><p>As you enter Turn 17, La Rascasse, you're right on the bumper of the lead vehicle. 17 is a 90-degree right, and you think you've got the nerves to take the lead on the inside. </p><p></p><p>You dive into the corner, trying to hold your highly aggressive line. Unfortunately, your aging vehicle is just not able to keep its grip, and you feel it beginning to slip. If you keep this up, there's a chance you can hold it, but an equal chance you'll spin, hit the wall, and possibly scratch the paint.</p><p></p><p>You have to choose, and quickly. The police sirens are getting closer.</p><p></p><p>Instead of completing the turn, you straighten the wheel and head toward a slope in the course barrier. You use the barricade as a ramp, and launch yourself off the road, and sail over the crowd. </p><p></p><p>You land the car, and drive away, with the police unable to follow. You make one stop, at a gas station, to refuel the car and give it a quick wash and wax, before taking it back to the museum where Prince Rainier's collection is housed. </p><p></p><p>As you pull the car back into its spot, the police are waiting for you. You prepare yourself to be taken into custody. It was worth it to get to drive in the Circuit de Monaco, the most famous of all F1 races.</p><p></p><p>There is a man standing with the police. The man is middle-aged, dressed in a well-tailored suit, and he's smiling warmly. You'd know that face anywhere: it's Albert II, Crown Prince of Monaco!</p><p></p><p>"Prince Albert," you say apologetically. "I'm sorry I borrowed your car without asking, but you see, the committee——"</p><p></p><p>He waves you off. "I understand. Blast the committee! I'm just happy to see one of my father's favorite cars put through its paces again."</p><p></p><p>He turns to the police.</p><p></p><p>"Officers, I see no reason to press charges. Were you watching the race today? I say, the real crime would be for a beautiful machine like this to be locked away in a museum forever, never to experience its true purpose under the steady the hands of a real driver."</p><p></p><p>You thank the Prince, and ask if you can use the bathroom. He invites you to lunch, and you have a nice dish of fish, and then some kind of lemon thing.
