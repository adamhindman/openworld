You are called in to help bust up a group of shetani that have been haunting a local school. Shetani are a sort of monster or demon known to the Makonde people of Tanzania and Mozambique. Shetani appear as distorted, asymmetrical humanoid or animal creatures. They cause trouble in different ways: from making milk curdle, to hiding household items, to committing unspeakable acts of violence. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, so far, these have just been disrupting class, and making life difficult for the janitor by creating a big mess in the bathrooms.</p><p></p><p>\"Better put a stop to them before it gets worse, anyway,\" says Jorge, the lead \"exorcist\" in your little group.</p><p></p><p>When you arrive at the school, Jorge tells you to wait outside the classroom while he and his team drive off the Shetani. He intends to read certain verses from the Quran, which are known to banish evil spirits like this, while the other members of the team perform other rites to cleanse the school, and ward away any future incursions.</p><p></p><p>\"You want me to just wait outside? Why can't I come in and help?\" you ask, trying not to sound too disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Jorge nods. \"It will be dangerous. You should wait outside, and try to ignore anything you hear. Do not open the door, even if you my voice begging you. It may not be me, it may be the Shetani.\?</p><p></p><p>You pass by nervous teachers and children as you enter the school. The classroom where the disturbances are taking is at the far side of the building. It seems colder here, and despite the electric lights, the air has a feeling of abiding darkness. When the team enters, Jorge shakes your hand, and you nod at each other. He shuts the door behind them, and lock from the outside, then wait in the hallway, listening.</p><p></p><p>You hear chanting in Arabic. You hear hissing, and chittering laughter, and a sound like leaves blowing across concrete. More chanting in Arabic. You smell sulfur, and other foul things. There are loud banging noises, and furniture being scraped. You hear screams — human screams, you think — and then silence.</p><p></p><p>The silence persists for several moments. Then, there is someone at the door, rattling it desperately, and pounding on it with their fists. </p><p></p><p>\"Let us out! Let us out! I know what I told you, but it's time to let us out!\"</p><p></p><p>You hesitate, hand on the lock. This might be a trick.</p><p></p><p>\"Recite those verses again,\" you say. \"The ones that banish the demons.\"</p><p></p><p>The pounding stops. The doorknob stops rattling. </p><p></p><p>After a moment, a voice from the other side of the door starts chanting in a low voice, in Arabic. You recognize the words, they are the same ones Jorge spoke a few moments before. This might be Jorge. It's probably Jorge. But if it's not, then it's whatever has just killed Jorge and his team, and you're about to let it out.</p><p></p><p>When he finishes reciting, you hold your breath and unlock the door. It swings open immediately, to reveal three people. They are sweaty, and their clothes are torn, and they look very much the worse for wear. But, they are smiling weakly.</p><p></p><p>\"That was a tough job,\" says Jorge. \"A popobawa. The worst kind of Shetani. Very, uhh, violent. Potentially. But, we got rid of them for good.\"</p><p></p><p>He puts his hand on your shoulder. </p><p></p><p>\"You did the right thing, locking the door. And not opening it until you were sure it was us. You've got good instincts. You'd make a good member of my team, if you ever wanted to join us,\" he says warmly.</p><p></p><p>You all go out for a meal of </em>dobrada</em>, a dish of tripe and beans. You wash it down with some cold beer, and at the end of the meal Jorge presents you with a badge that says \"Honorary Junior Shetani Buster\".
