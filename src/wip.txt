Pico Cão Grande is a traffic-cone shaped volcanic plug which rises like an enormous witch's hat out of the jungles of São Tomé and Príncipe, to a height of 2175 feet above sea level.</p><p></p><p>While climbing it, you discover that the steep, moss-slick sides of the peak are literally crawling with snakes. Seems like everywhere you want to put your hands or feet has a snake there already. They hiss angry warnings at you, but stand their ground.</p><p></p><p>Equally stubborn, you continue to climb, not wanting to give up on your dream of reaching the top. You sustain multiple bites from a several different species, all venemous. Fortunately, you have been bitten by so many snakes on your trip already that you've developed a fairly strong immunity to most types of snake venom, and are able to proceed, though not without significant discomfort.</p><p></p><p>Pico Cão Grande is Portuguese for "Great Dog Peak". As you stand at the summit and look out over the jungle, your eyes almost completely swollen shut from the snake bites on your forehead, you wonder where the name comes from. Is it because the remarkably tall, sharply-pointed mountain looks like a dog's tooth? Or, might one of the original discoverers have had a great dog he was commemorating by naming a landmark after it?</p><p></p><p>Head aching, and heart racing, you sit down to catch your breath, and stop the world from spinning. </p><p></p><p>The next thing you know, you're waking up in the middle of the night. Initially unsure about where you are, you eventually realize that, in a venom-induced break from reality, you must have climbed a few hundred feet down the almost vertical eastern flank of the mountain. You are now perched on a narrow shelf of rock about eight inches wide, with approximately nine hundred feet of empty space underneath you. The lights of Vila Clotilde wink in the distance, and the larger town of São João dos Angolares can be seen as a glow on the horizon.</p><p></p><p>After a minute or two, you notice that several snakes have their jaws clamped onto you. By this point, you've been bitten so often, you can barely notice them! Your immunity is very nearly complete, and though you're still feeling feverish and weak, you laugh scornfully at their ongoing attempts to kill you. </p><p></p><p>\"On your way, little ones,\" you say, pulling the snakes off your legs and neck, and sending them slinking back into the innumerable cracks and crevices where they make their nests. </p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, you do feel tired, and your fingers and toes are still swollen. Keeping that in mind, and allowing some added caution due to the darkness, you decide not to do any more climbing tonight. Lying on your side, you are able to catch a few hours of precarious sleep on the narrow shelf.</p><p></p><p>By the next morning, as the humid mist floats up from the jungle floor, you feel fine. Though eager to get back the rest of your vacation, you are reluctant to start, since it means giving up this incredible view of the island. Ultimately, the rumbling of your hungry belly entices you to get moving, and you are able to resume your descent without further incident. </p><p></p><p>Indeed, the way down is easier than the way up, because you don't need to pay any attention to the snakes, except to admire the beauty of their colorful, scaly skin.
