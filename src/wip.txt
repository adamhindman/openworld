Poland contains 28 different mountain ranges, and the Crown contains the highest peak in each range. You decide to hike to the summit of every peak in the last, and to do it all in one day!</p><p></p><p>You get an early start, climbing the mount Rysy in the High Tatras. At just over 2500 meters, it is the tallest peak on the list, so it's nice to get it out of the way early. </p><p></p><p>Next you hit Wielka Sowa, a much shorter peak in the Owl Mountains. When you get to the summit, you find that contains a concrete and granite structure called a Bismarck Tower! These towers were built in honor of Germany's first chancellor, Otto Von Bismarck, and were used as signal beacons and observatories. You ascend the stairs to the top of the tower and look out over the countryside below: just gorgeous! You snap a photo of yourself, and help some other tourists take snapshots too.</p><p></p><p>By the time you make it to the next mountain, Skrzyczne in the Silesian Beskids, it is already late afternoon. This presents a difficulty for your original plan to hike all the mountains in a single day. You realize that you forgot to include travel time in your calculations.</p><p></p><p>\"But what really is a day, though, if you stop and think about it?\"</p><p></p><p>You decide to change the terms of the challenge a little bit. Instead of defining a \"day\" as a single 24 hour period, you will think of it as the time between waking and sleeping, however long that is. As long as you can stay awake, you tell yourself, <em>my</em> day has not ended. </p><p></p><p>You vow to climb the remaining 25 peaks without sleeping.</p><p></p><p>The next 6 peaks go by easily. You yawn a bit while summiting the jewel of the Bystrzyckie Mountains, Jogodna, but it only makes you quicken your pace to get the blood flowing. </p><p></p><p>Morning comes as you are hiking up Ślęża, a relatively short (700 meter) mountain with a lot of history. The slopes of this granite hill are covered in ruins, and you stop to admire a statue of a bear, carved by ancient Celts untold centuries ago. The bear waves at you and tells you not to give up, and you wave back. </p><p></p><p>That afternoon, after crossing a few more mountains off your list, you look around and wonder where you are. You are still walking up a pleasant, grassy slope, but you don't remember which mountain you're on. You seem to have zoned out for a while. You stop some other hikers and ask them the name of the place, and they tell you you're almost to the top of Tarnica, a 1300-meter wonder in the Bieszczady Mountains. </p><p></p><p>\"Are you all right?\" they ask, and \"When is the last time you slept?\"</p><p></p><p>You check your watch. </p><p></p><p>\"About 38 hours ago, but technically—\"</p><p></p><p>You start to tell them about the mission you've set for yourself, but their faces disappear. Soon you realize you've been talking to some bushes growing on the side of the trail. For no clear reason, you apologize for wasting their time, and then continue along the path, shaking your head to try to clear it.</p><p></p><p>At midnight, you are climbing the second tallest massif in the Crown, Babia Góra. Ahead of you, you see a bonfire burning, and a group of women cackling and dancing around it. Colorful wisps of smoke rise up from the fire, making strange shapes in the air that move with what seems like a kind of malevolent intelligence. This must be the witches' sabbath, something you've heard about in folk tales associated with this region. </p><p></p><p>You pinch yourself, trying to figure out whether it is a hallucination or not. No matter how many times you try to blink away the vision, it is still there when you open your eyes. At last you decide to sneak past it.</p><p></p><p>The next day, your feet are almost too heavy to lift as you drag yourself up Łysica, the 28th and final mountain on the list. You saved this one for last on purpose, because at only 600 meters, it is also the shortest mountain by a good margin. You knew you'd be a little tired, and could use a \"gimme\".</p><p></p><p>Looking down at your feet, you realize that at some point you must have taken off your shoes. They are nowhere to be found, and by the amount of dried mud on your soles, they might be miles away. You're also wearing an entirely different pair of pants, with no recollection of where you got them. </p><p></p><p>\"I sure could use a rest,\" you say. Your eyelids begin to close. </p><p></p><p>\"Don't give up, you're almost there!\" says an oddly familiar voice. </p><p></p><p>You keep walking, but your eyes are closed now. Does it count as sleep if you don't stop hiking?</p><p></p><p>\"It's been 60 hours,\" you say, \"I've earned a little nap.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Actually, you lost a day somewhere in there. It's been almost 80 hours. But look, you're there! You've reached the summit.\"</p><p></p><p>Your eyes snap open. Sure enough, there is no more mountain to climb. In fact, you've reached the highest possible point in the  entire Świętokrzyskie range. Looking back down from where you came, you see the trail you've just followed, switchbacking its way down the mountain, back to the nearby village of Święta Katarzyna. In the distance, you see farms, forests, and rivers. Beyond them, dim and hazy, the peaks of other mountains already climbed.</p><p></p><p>Beside you stands an older woman, evidently the source of the voice. She tells you her name, and says that she's been following you for the last few peaks, after you told her what you were doing. She was worried about your health. </p><p></p><p>\"I kept telling you this was a terrible idea, but you wouldn't give up, so I thought I'd better help you finish.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Thank you. But, I have to ask: are you real, or just another hallucination?\"</p><p></p><p>She slaps you across the face. It feels real, but it's hard to know. Tears well up in your eyes, both because of her generousity, and because you just realized your journey is actually over. You lay down beside a log and go to sleep, waking in the dark to find yourself alone.</p><p>
