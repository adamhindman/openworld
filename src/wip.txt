After arriving in Pyongyang, you manage to slip away from your government-issued handler and spend the day touring the city by yourself. You witness a city isolated from the world, on the verge of starvation, economically stagnant, culturally insular, and under constant surveillance. </p><p></p><p>Still, the average person on the street is eager to point you in the right direction with a nervous smile on their face, and a sort of friendly desperation in their eyes. They keep glancing around to see if the police are watching whenever you approach them, but seem happy to help once it has been established that they are not in trouble.</p><p></p><p>You need no help to find the Ryugyong Hotel. This massive pyramidal structure, 105-stories tall, dominates the skyline of the otherwise unimpressive downtown of Pyongyang. It has been under construction in occasionaly bursts since 1987, but if it is ever finished, it will have 3,000 rooms. It looks very impressive from the outside.</p><p></p><p>That night, under cover of darkness, you make your way into the Ryugyong Hotel. You find the interior almost empty, with its only occupants a few bored, yawning watchment who are easy to sneak past. Beyond the lobby and a few model rooms, there is almost no furniture, fixtures, or even lightbulbs. The elevators are not turned on, or perhaps not operational, so you have to climb 105 floors up the damp stairwell to get to the top.</p><p></p><p>The top floor is the relatively small tip of the pyramid, which which you can see the circle of lights that defines the shape of the city. Beyond that, the night stretches out forever: farms and empty wilderness as dark as they were in the middle ages.
