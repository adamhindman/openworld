\"Boca do Inferno\", the Mouth of Hell, is a seaside cave on the Portuguese coast. The force of the incoming tide drives waves through a narrow mouth of stone. When the water smashes the back wall of the cliff, it roils and crashes, throwing spray and foam into the air, and making a terrific roar. All of this is can be seen from above, and it is an impressive sight indeed.</p><p></p><p>After a lunch of caldeirada and dark bread, you take an afternoon nap in your hotel room. Awakening at sunset, you make your way out to the seaside after dark. The tourists are gone now, and you've got the place to yourself.  </p><p></p><p>You stand at the guardrail above the chasm, watching the turbulent water brawling with the cliffs. The moon is high and full, and clear enough to read the warning signs telling you not to climb over the rail, because it could be dangerous. </p><p></p><p>\"More than dangerous. It is entirely fatal, I assure you.\"</p><p></p><p>Looking up, you see an old man standing beside you. He is bald, a little bit with, with a severe mouth, and a keen, perceptive gaze. The moonlight shines through him, giving him a slight translucency that lets you know he is probably a ghost.</p><p></p><p>\"You read my mind!\" you say. </p><p></p><p>The ghost introduces himself as Aleister Crowley. He tells you that he once faked his death by pretending to leap from this very spot. You ask him why he did that.</p><p></p><p>\"Well, I was a fraud. I pretended to do a lot of things. That was pretty much my whole deal.\"</p><p></p><p>\"What were some other things you did?\"</p><p></p><p>\"Well, I pretended to summon a demon. I pretended to talk to the Roman gods Mercury and Jupiter. I started my own fake religion based around having sex with me. I wrote some books that were mostly garbage. Stuff like that.\" He shrugs.</p><p></p><p>\"Are you now doomed to talk the earth to atone for your sins in life?\"</p><p></p><p>Crowley shakes his head.</p><p></p><p>\"You'd think so, but no, I managed to avoid that. I just like coming back here to watch the waves. It's a nice spot, isn't it?\" </p><p></p><p>In silent agreement, you both stop chatting and turn back to the ocean beneath you. The ceaseless churning of the waves is ancient, primal, powerful. The rhythm has a hypnotic effect, and you lose track of time. </p><p></p><p>When you look up again, the ghost of Aleister Crowley has vanished. The moonlight hits the empty pavement where he stood only moments before. He is gone, though perhaps his troubled spirit is finally at rest.</p><p></p><p>But then on the way back to the car, you see him coming out of the restroom, and heading back to the cliff again.
