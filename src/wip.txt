In the desert lands of Syria stand the ruins of over 700 ancient towns and settlements, all abandoned over a thousand years ago. They're called the Dead Cities, and one of the most impressive is the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites. </p><p>You arrive at the site in the morning, when the air is still cool, and unload your truck full lumber, with a few befuddled tourists looking on.</p><p>Saint Simeon the Stylite was an ascetic hermit who lived in the 5th century. He wandered in the wilderness, contemplating the meaning of the spiritual world, and generally eschewing the ecumenical one. He became so famous for his holiness that people flocked to him, and, in his mind, this defeated the purpose of being a hermit in the first place.</p><p>So, like you're doing today, he built a pillar and climbed up to a small platform on top of it, whereon he could consider the mysteries of the world in peace and quiet. </p><p>His first platform was three meters tall, but evidently that wasn't enough. Crowds continued to throng beneath him, asking him to perform miracles, and teach them the secrets of life, and so on. Multiple emperors even sought his advice, when all he really wanted was some time to think. </p><p>Eventually, Simeon decided to build a second platform, this one 18 meters high. That's a column 60 feet in the air, atop which St. Simeon spent all his days and nights, until his death.</p><p>You complete your own 18-meter pillar by noon, and carefully climb up to the top to eat your lunch. You brought a pita sandwich and some dates, and a can of soda.</p><p>Beneath you, more than a dozen tourists have gathered to take pictures of the hastily-built wooden structure. You dangle your legs over the edge of the platform, and look out at the great sweep of the arid hills around you. </p><p>As you chew your sandwich, you think about the nature of good and evil, and let your mind follow certain paths you'd never considered going down before. It feels, in a way, like being so thoroughly separated from the petty concerns of the world below you has allowed you to operate on a higher plane. Right around the time you swallow your last bite of sandwich, you achieve enlightenment, which elicits a slight belch.</p><p>When Saint Simeon died, the empire commissioned a massive and elaborate church be built on the site. A huge dome was erected around his pillar, like it was a holy object. Though the site was abandoned centuries later, pilgrims continued to visit the church, and chip away fragments of the pillar as keepsakes. Slowly, Simeon's pillar was worn down to a nub and scattered to hundreds of reliquaries and private collections all over the world. </p><p>In the early afternoon, police from Aleppo arrive and force you down off your pillar. You watch from the ground as the wooden pillar is cut down by a police chainsaw (it's a a chainsaw with the logo of the Aleppo police on it: what would you call it?) The debris is loaded into a dumptruck, and taken to the dump.</p><p>The subject of arrest and jail time is broached. Using your newly-acquired enlightened wisdom, you impress the chief of police enough that he lets you off with a fine, and a stern warning. Later that evening, the enlightenment wears off.
