\"We're going all the way down,\" you say, growling with finality. The look of grim determination on your face stifles any further argument from the pilot, who winces at the bruise he can feel forming, and turns back to the controls without further comment.</p><p>You are hunkered inside the <em>Gravity IV</e,>, a deep diving submersible, currently 2000 meters below the surface of the Pacific. Below you is another four kilometers of water, and then the ocean floor. Somewhere down there in all that darkness is your yellow flashlight, which fell overboard while you were taking a selfie on deck. In your dreams, you watch it tumbling from your hands, helpless to catch it. It slides below the surface of the water, greening for an instant through the lens of the water, and then dimming as it sinks out of sight.</p><p></p><p>And now you are following its path down into the Galathea Deep, 6000 meters down. The submersible you're in is rated for that depth, but the pilot lost his nerve when the captain cracked his head on the vessel's low ceiling, and fell unconscious. He pleaded to return to the surface, but you reminded him of the contract he'd signed.</p><p>Finally, you had to result to force to keep him at his station.</p><p>\"The captain will be fine,\" you assured him then, rubbing your stinging knuckles.</p><p>You repeat the same words now. The captain is asleep, his breathing regular. He is strapped into his chair to keep him upright, since there's no place to lay him down in the tiny capsule.</p><p></p><p>Gravity descends through the bathylpelagic zone, also called the midnight zone because of its sheer, almost uninterrupted blackness. Occasionally, you catch glimpses of bioluminescent through the porthole, like stars hanging in the sky at night. This is the bottom of the sea, past which there is only the abyss.</p><p></p><p>At 5000 meters, you are in the middle of a dead zone in which there is no oxygen to support plant or animal life, and the water hovers just above freezing. The only animals here are invertebrates and certain unusually hardy fish, gluttons for punishment, who can wishstand the 11,000 pounds per square inch of pressure from the overhanging column of water.</p><p>You watch as the alien shape of a jellyfish slides past the window. You see anglerfish, dangling their flashlight lures in front of them.</p><p>Suddenly, you see a long shadow cross your field of vision.</p><p>A shadow? Not possible. There's no light down here to cast one!</p><p>Massive, tentacles have wrapped themselves around your craft, obscuring the vehicle's searchlights as they pass in front of them. The submersible creaks and groans as the tentacles constrict it tightly, squeezing with what must be incredible strength. Through the tiny window, you can see that each tentacle is covered with hundreds of suckers.</p><p></p><p>A giant squid!</p><p>\"It's pulling us down!\" the pilot screams, wrenching the controls fruitlessly, as though he could use them to steer his way out of a death grip.</p><p></p><p>The craft begins to shake violently as the squid spirals downward into the darkness, rolling as it falls like a bullet twisting in the air. You are thrown against the walls, again and again, and feel something in your rib cage crack. The pilot, buckled into his chair, merely emits a continuous scream of terror.</p><p></p><p>\"Orange... switch...\" you hear a voice say. It is the captain, awake, eyes half open.</p><p></p><p>The panicked pilot doesn't seem to have heard the captain, or noticed him, but you manage to crawl across the cabin floor and reach your hand out to just barely touch the smooth orange plastic switch in the middle of the console: \"outer surface voltage\" it says. You flip it.</p><p></p><p>A scream reverberates through the capsule, and the squid immediately releases the submersible. It flees upward and away, trailing a cloud of ink darker than the dark water itself.</p><p></p><p>The craft comes to rest on the floor of the ocean. Six thousand meters below sea level is the mouth of hell: Literally, because this area is named after Hades himself. The pressure here is enormous, and life only exists because of the warm, nutrient-rich deep sea vents that spew red-hot toxic gas from the bowels of the earth. This Hadal Zone is found only in nightmares and deep sea trenches, and it was first discovered by a previous expedition to this very part of the ocean.</p><p>When the captain comes around, he explains how giant squid can be a big problem down here, and that deep divers have started adding defenses against them, like the electric field you activated when you threw that switch.</p><p>\"Not enough to kill the beast, but enough to make it think twice.\"</p><p></p><p>\"I thought giant squid were extremely rare,\" you say.</p><p></p><p>\"I wish that were true.\" He sighs, shaking his head. \"No. Ignore what you see on the National Geographic. They're a menace at this depth.\"</p><p></p><p>When the inky water has dispersed, you can easily spot your yellow flashlight not far from where you landed. The titanium housing looks like it's held up well to the pressure; even the glass looks to be intact.</p><p>The pilot skillfully retrieves it with the remote-manipulation arms, and you feel a sense of relief to have it back, safe and sound.
