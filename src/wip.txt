While out for an afternoon sail along the coast of Namibia, your dhow crashes onto a rocky beach. The mast is smashed to splinters, and the hull is stove in on a jagged rock the size of a small car. This ship isn't going anywhere.</p><p></p><p>The radio is another casualty: you pick up the broken pieces of your communications equipment and throw them on the ground in frustration. </p><p></p><p>After a few minutes, you begin accept the reality of your situation: you are just another shipwreck on the Skeleton Coast.</p><p></p><p>The Skeleton Coast is a 200 kilometer stretch of beach where, due to strong tidal effects, ships that wash up here often can't get back out to sea. It is an inhospital place, often so shrouded in fog that it is hard to see, yet it gets so little precipitation that it is considered a desert: water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. </p><p></p><p>No humans live here, but thousands of rusted ships litter the sands, dry and jagged as bones. These skeletal remains give the place its English name, but the name the locals gave it is even more evocative: \"The Land God Made in Anger\". </p><p></p><p>After a few days of waiting for rescue, you survey your remaining food and water. It is a meager stockpile, not even enough for two full days of travel. Worried, but determined, you toss it all into a small sack, along with some cinnamon gum and your yellow flashlight, a change of clothes, some matches, and a bottle of sunscreen. </p><p></p><p>With mountains to the east, and more of the Namib desert beyond them, the way before you is clear: Swakopomund is a hundred kilometers away, across the soft, arid sands. Throwing the bag over your shoulder, you begin to walk.</p><p></p><p>On a beach empty of footprints, you walk all through the night. The full moon hangs above you like a spotlight. You watch crabs skittering across the wet sand, and try to catch some. You succeed only in getting pinched by tiny crab claws, which sends you running away howling in pain.</p><p></p><p>The nezt day, with the sun beating down, and the heat climbing to over 100 degrees fahrenheit, you hide in the shade of a large boulder. You take small sips of the warm water through your cracked lips, rationing the water as best you can. Each drop is precious, and with every sip you watch your last liter dwindling down to nothing. </p><p></p><p>On the second night, as you are make your way along the coast, you see lights appraching in the distance. These are the headlights of two small quad bikes, driven by men with guns over their shoulders. On the back of the bikes are large, well-secured packages loaded with who-knows-what. Smugglers, taking a risky trip through this no man's land. </p><p></p><p>With a cracked, rasping voice, you beg them to take you with them. They glance at the packages they're carrying: \"no room\". Whatever they are carrying, it is more valuable than your life.</p><p></p><p>They don't rescue you, but in a gesture of almost miraculous humanity, they do toss you several bottles of water. They look at you with pity as one of the bottles disappears immediately down your parched thoat, then sputter on down the beach and out of earshot. </p><p></p><p>\"Thank you!\" you croak after them in a weak, ragged voice.</p><p></p><p>On the third day, when your water supply is exhausted again, you hit upon an idea. You decide to sacrifice two of your empty plastic bottles to rig up a contraption that catches the condensation of evaporating seawater. After a long, nervous afternoon of waiting in the hot sun, you manage to almost fill your two remaining bottles, and for the first time are able to drink your fill.</p><p></p><p>That night, you devise a method to catch crabs: instead of grabbing them with your fingers, you smash them with a long stick. You harvest a half dozen of the small crabs, and roast them over the fire. Despite the lack of seasoning, they taste delicious. </p><p></p><p>After eighteen more days of talking, you stagger into Swakopomund. You are surprised to hear German voices greeting you, but then you remember that Swakopomund is an isolated, former German colonial town, where many people still speak the old language. </p><p></p><p>\"Guten tag!\" you call you, waving.</p><p></p><p>The locals stare at you. You are filthy, covered in blood from various sources, draped in a hyena pelt, and holding a rusted scimitar and a bag of gems. </p><p></p><p>There simply isn't time to explain the pack of hyenas you fought, or ancient Barbary pirate ship you plundered, but to be sure, they were unique and fulfilling adventures that you'll never forget.
