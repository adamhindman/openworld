On it, the flag of Mars flaps proudly, if frantically in a fierce and nearly constant gale.</p><p></p><p>You notice that the design of the flag is based on the flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines: it is a red-and-white triband, with five red diamonds in the center, describing a letter 'M'.</p><p></p><p>You ask one of the astronauts whether there is a national anthem, and he tells you no. Later that night, he pulls you aside and tells you that he's been working on some lyrics that he'd like your opinion about.</p><p></p><p>_Mars, Mars, you're big, and red, and ours_</p><p>_Your poles are packed with water ice,_</p><p>_Your sky is full of stars..._</p><p></p><p>"Is that all you have so far?" you ask.</p><p></p><p>He nods. "It's not done, but what do you think?" he raises one eyebrow while sticking out his thumb, pointing it up, then down, then up again, then down again. </p><p></p><p>"Good start," you say, politely.
