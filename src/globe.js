You wonder how human beings could construct such an impressive structure using 4000 year old technology. Some people believe that advanced aliens helped the Pharoahs using their tractor beams. Sounds crazy, but is it true?</p><p>At last you determine to settle the question once and for all. You will rebuild the Great Pyramid, stone by stone, using nothing that the ancient Egyptians would not have had on hand: wooden cranes, rollers, ropes made of braided reeds.</p><p>You decide that the easiest way to do this is to disassemble the pyramid and rebuild it in place. Starting in the evening, after the last tourist has left, you painstakingly remove each limestone block and number it, so you'll know how to put it back exactly as it was.</p><p>It's not easy: each block that makes up the exterior surface weighs over two tons! Soon you find you're sweating, and have to pause to catch your breath.</p><p>At around 1:30 in the morning, you reach the halfway mark: the pyramid has been taken apart and neatly piled into stacks. It's a surreal and unbelievable sight not witnessed since 2600 BC.</p><p>You work throughout the night. As the full desert moon drops, and the rising sun begins to glow in the east, you fit each numbered block back into place. You're nervous about being discovered, but finally manage to straighten the granite slabs in the Pharoah's tomb just as the first bus load of visitors pulls into view. They begin snapping pictures and taking selfies, oblivious to your night's work. It's done, and nobody even noticed the difference!</p><p>In the end, you're satisfied that the ancient Egyptians could have built this mighty monument, but there's one thing you can't stop thinking about: in the basement of the pyramid, under a flimsy tarp, you found an alien spacecraft, covered with dust and sand.",
